## About Project

Sea Foods is a project that enlists dishes of sea life regarded as food. Users get to interact to items in the list by liking and commenting on them after viewing some more information on a particular dish on a popup modal.

This project uses [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) API for populating the list of sea foods and the [Involvement](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) API for adding likes and comments to any sea food item.
